The experiments were corried out with a group of 30 volunteers from 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the 
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity 
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

A full description of the data is available here: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was 
used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

For each record, the original dataset provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

This respository works with the combined train and test files, in order to include all data captured in the study. This
combined dataframe also includes the activity level and subject for each record. 

Run_analysis.R will perform the following steps:
1. Merge training and test sets to create one dataset, 'big_data'
2. Extract only measurements on mean and std per variable, and save it in a new dataset called 'big_data1'
3. Transform the numeric activity labels to their names
4. Label the dataset with the variable describing the feature observed
5. Create an independent 'averages' datset that contains the average of each variable per activity per subject

Notes
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
