Background on dataset used in assignment

The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and
information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially
covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining
whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX
for some background on this particular topic).


We will use the outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.

Programming Assignments:

1. Find the best hospital in a state for a given condition
2. Rank hospitals by outcome for given condition in a state
3. Rank hospitals by outcome in all states for a given condition, then identify hospitals across states by rank
